# Simple-OOP-Project: Bank Management System
Simple OOP Project without file handling in C++

Tried to understand the code 
it is basic handling of the bank account created
it includes creating , modifying and controling a bank account by depositing and saving money.

however some improvement could be made like authentication of user.

not exactly sure how to implement in the form of code :(

making little changes in readme file for raising pull request
